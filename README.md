I developed this in the NetBeans IDE. It provided a comprehensive way to structure my whole project. 
I created a backend jdbc database containing columns for the required data. Then built a GUI and linked it to the database.
A user can add, delete, and update records through the GUI. Some of the main other features are: 
Sorting data in the table, data validation on the input fields, and notifications on actions performed and errors.
